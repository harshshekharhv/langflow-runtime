# langflow-runtime

A Knative function exposing an API to run custom flows of Langflow via flow names.

## Endpoints

Running this function will expose three endpoints.

  * `/` The endpoint for running a flow via langflow-runtime.
  * `/health/readiness` The endpoint for a readiness health check
  * `/health/liveness` The endpoint for a liveness health check

The health checks can be accessed in your browser at
[http://localhost:8080/health/readiness]() and
[http://localhost:8080/health/liveness]().

You can use `func invoke` to send an HTTP request to the function endpoint.


## Testing

This function project includes a [unit test](./test_func.py). Update this
as you add business logic to your function in order to test its behavior.

```console
python test_func.py
```
